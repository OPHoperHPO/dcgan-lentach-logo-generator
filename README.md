# Where to find the dataset.
DATASET IS CONSISTENT FROM THE LENTACH LOGO. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT YOURSELF FROM https://vk.com/oldlentach
I do not own this dataset.

# How to use this project:
```python3 train.py``` - Train model
```python3 generate_single_image.py``` - Generate single image

I modified train model script and wrote single image generator. =)
